# DSC180A-Q1-Codebase

To get the FER2013 dataset, go to this drive and download the "archive" file. Place this file in the data folder from this GitHub.


The code for preprocessing will not be needed as that creates the Dartmouth_predictions.csv file which we already have in the data folder. 

Running the cells within the FER2013_DeepFace.ipynb will provide you with the results our model attained from the FER2013 dataset. You will
see the graphs, tables, and confusion matrix.

Running the cells within the Dartmouth_DeepFace.ipynb will provide you with the results our model attained from the Dartmouth Children's dataset. You will see the graphs, tables, and confusion matrix.
